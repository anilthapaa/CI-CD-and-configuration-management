# GitHub Actions Mastery Challenge â€“ Weather App CI/CD

This project is part of a hands-on challenge to evaluate our understanding of GitHub Actions. It features a browser-based weather app that uses the OpenWeather API. We implemented a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that securely injects API keys using GitHub Secrets.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate CI/CD automation
- Use secrets and environment variables
- Customize GitHub Actions YAML workflows
- Apply best practices in workflow design

## Tech Stack
- HTML, JavaScript
- Node.js for scripts
- GitHub Actions for CI
